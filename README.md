Xenos
=====

Windows dll injector. Based on Blackbone library - https://github.com/DarthTon/Blackbone

## Changes from the original repository ##
- Up-to-date blackbone library
- Fixed source code (It wouldn't compile without additional fixes, at least with the newer blackbone library)
- Hopefully no references to xenos in the code, metadata, configs, which reduces the amount of possible anti-cheat detection vectors.

## Notes for compiling in Visual Studio 2019 ##
- You must install all .NET SDK's in the visual studio installer.
- You must compile in x64.

## Recommended ##
- Use a vac bypass loader paired with this injector. Although having vac bypass defeats the whole purpose of having a beastmode injector.
